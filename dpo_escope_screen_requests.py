#
# Using the Python Requests library to communicate with the web server
# (eScope) you can retrieve a PNG image of the screen.  This is a
# hacked version of Dave W's example code from the Tektronix user
# forum.
#
# Tested On
# TDS3014 v3.41
#
# From Dave W's older code:
# "There is no documentation on this, there probably never will be and
# future firmware may change the behavior of eScope which this
# demonstration relies heavily on.
#
# YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
#
# ...snip...
#
# Should work on any eScope enabled instrument."
