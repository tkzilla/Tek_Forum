# Name:  DPO MSO 2000 Series Search and Mark on CH1 get Value on CH2
# Purpose:  This example demonstrates how to use the Search and Marks feature of
# the DPO/MSO 2000(B) Series instruments to find an event of interest on one
# channel, but then read back the value at that same point in time on another
# channel.
#
# Created:  2016-09-27
#
# Development Environment: Python 3.4, PyVisa 1.8, NI-VISA 2016, Windows 8.1
#
# Compatible Instruments: DPO/MSO 2000(B) Series Oscilloscopes
#
# Compatible Interfaces:  USB, Ethernet
#
# Tektronix provides the following example "AS IS" with no support or warranty.

For this reason you'll want to retrieve the start and end and average the two to get the position that is right in the middle.
